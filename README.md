# Scratch-112

This includes a partially made block based programming language that is interpreted into Python.
You can run the program by running the main.py file in the terminal.

## Features

What currently works is the drag and drop block placing. When dragging a block, placing dropping it on top of another block will snap that block underneath and make it the next line of code to be made.
The interpreter works for the function definition blocks, the variable blocks, the return block, the operations blocks, and the for loop block (except assigning more code to the for loop). Code is generated by the interpreter and written out to the Output.py file.

## Disclaimer

Please run this project in Python 3.10 or later
