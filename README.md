# Scratch-112

This includes a partially made block based programming language that is interpreted into Python.
You can run the program by running the main.py file in the terminal.

## Features

What currently works is the drag and drop block placing. When dragging a block, placing dropping it on top of another block will snap that block underneath and make it the next line of code to be made.
The interpreter works for the function definition blocks, the variable blocks, the return block and the operations block. Code is generated by the interpreter and written out to the Output.py file.
